### Routing

- Link of next/link allow you link pages with href
- routing in next allow you link static and dynamic pages
- the router will be routing de file named to root like this /page/blog/post
- the index.js in pages directory will be root adress of you site index.js = "/"
- the routers are automatically nested for you and this is beultifull
- if you want to use dynamic pages you should to use [params] in you file

### dynamic routes

- Link is used in dynamic pages to just type Link with "href" and "as" props. where "href" in the dynamic page route and "as" is the path you want link.

- useRouter of next/use is used to complete the Link he is complex so i write about it another time
- exist various params for dynamic pages each one have a different value
- [slug], [comment] and [...]
- slug - allow anything value after '/' like post/:slug
- comment - allow anything value after slug like post/[slug]/[comment]
- ... allow you get all value after '/' like post/a/1/2/3/c it get a/1/2/3/c

### dynamic imports

- next suport dynamic import es2020
- it possible to use dynamic from next/dynamic for imports dynamic modules like import
- the sintax is easy to learn
- it possible too to use promises in dynamic imports just use '.then()'
- dynamic of next/dynamic can recieve a object to execute while de import not done.

### automatic Static Optimization

- the some page can dont use ssg and ssr this page will be automatically static page in build-time
- pages ssr are not static page it is obvious so you can not do nothing about it
