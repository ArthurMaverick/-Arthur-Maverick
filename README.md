## Projects

### Kubernetes Deployment Automation

I led a team in designing and implementing a Kubernetes deployment pipeline for a microservices-based application. This included optimizing Helm charts, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and implementing automated scaling strategies.

### Golang Microservices

Developed a suite of Golang microservices to enhance system automation. These services improved the efficiency of routine tasks and reduced manual intervention in deployment processes.

### AWS Infrastructure Automation

Architected and implemented AWS infrastructure using Terraform, allowing for scalable and cost-effective solutions. This included the setup of VPCs, EC2 instances, RDS databases, and more.

## Certifications

- AWS Certified
